This algorithm uses "odd days" to determine the day of an given date
User must input 3 arguments, month (first 3 letters, must be capitalised), day
(numeric form) and year (numeric form)

Below are rules from the reference source I used:
Odd days are the days more than complete number of weeks, aka reminders
Number of odd days in a non-leap year = 1
Number of odd days in a leap year = 2
Number of odd days in 100 years = 5
Number of odd days in 200 year = 3
Number of odd days in 300 years = 1
Number of odd days in 400 years = 0
Non â€“ centennial year is a leap year, if we divide by 4 and get no remainder
then its a leap year
Centennial year is a leap year, if we divide by 400 and get no remainder then
its a leap year

Number of odd days = 0, Day = Sunday
Number of odd days = 1, Day = Monday
Number of odd days = 2, Day = Tuesday
Number of odd days = 3, Day = Wednesday
Number of odd days = 4, Day = Thursday
Number of odd days = 5, Day = Friday
Number of odd days = 6, Day = Saturday

Input: Takes in 3 parameters
char, month - The month of the input, 1st input from argv
int, day - The day of the input, 2nd input from argv
int year - The year of the input, 3rd input from argv

Output: Returns integer
Uses the formula to caculate the odd days, using the 2nd set of rules
