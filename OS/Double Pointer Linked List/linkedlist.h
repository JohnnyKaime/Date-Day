*File - linkedlist.h
*
*Linkedlist file that contains all the function that a node
*and linkedlist can perform. The driver or main.c calls this to 
*while the main.c runs through the list of testcases, it calls
*each function inside linkedlist.
*
*A more detailed description is by each function level documentation
*Functions include the following:
*	InsertBefore A B - Adds B before A
*	InsertAfter A B - Add B after A
*	Rush A - Adds a node in the front of the list
*	Remove A - Removes a specific node
*	Append A - Adds a node to the back of the list
*	These below have user output
*		Head - Prints out first node
*		Tail - Prints out last node
*		PrintList - Prints out whole list wiht "-" between each node
*		Length - Prints out size of the list
