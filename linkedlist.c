/*
*Algorithm:
*This program reads a file say "test" and loops untill the end of it
*Then determines which type of command it is beetween the 6
*	Rush - Adds a node in the front of the list
*	Remove - Removes a specific node
*	Head - Prints out first node
*	Tail - Prints out last node
*	PrintList - Prints out whole list wiht "-" between each node
*	Length - Prints out size of the list
*Also checks the input if its valid
*	if not then error message is printed
*
*
*Description:
*Creates node structure used in the list
*	data - type char, stores the data or input from the file
*	node - type node, stores the next linked node
*
*Input:
*Nothing
*
*Output:
*Nothing
*
*Caveats:
*Only accepts char as data inputs
